## Context and Problem Statement

{Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question.}

## Decision Drivers

{driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
{driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
{…}

## Considered Options

* {option 1}
* {option 2}
* {option 3}
* {…}

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{option 1}", because {justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.

### Positive Consequences

* {e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, …}
* {…}

### Negative Consequences

* {e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, …}
* {…}

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### {option 1}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
* Bad, because {argument c}
* {…}

### {option 2}
